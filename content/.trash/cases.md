• July 24, 2015

• Restructuring of bankrupt tanker fleet Berlian Laju.

• Restructuring

based on trust

.

• tanker fleet, where the successful outcome was largely due to the trust the firm enjoyed in the eyes of the stakeholders.

The “BLT restructuring case” refers to HHP Law Firm’s role in the high-profile debt restructuring of

PT Berlian Laju Tanker Tbk (BLT)

, once one of Indonesia’s largest chemical tanker operators. This case was a landmark in Indonesian legal and corporate history for several reasons:

Background on BLT

• BLT was a major player in Asia’s shipping industry, particularly in transporting chemicals and oil.

• In early 2012, amid declining global shipping rates and overexpansion, BLT

defaulted on over US$2 billion in debt

.

• It was the

largest debt default

by an Indonesian company since the Asian Financial Crisis.

HHP’s Role

◇

Hadiputranto, Hadinoto & Partners (HHP)

, the Indonesian member firm of Baker McKenzie, served as

lead counsel for the company

.

◇ The firm advised BLT on its

multi-jurisdictional debt restructuring

, including both

Indonesian Suspension of Debt Payment (PKPU)

proceedings and overseas schemes involving bondholders and creditors.

◇ HHP worked closely with Baker McKenzie offices in Singapore and other jurisdictions due to BLT’s international creditor base.

On

July 24, 2015

, PT Berlian Laju Tanker Tbk (BLT) faced significant developments in its debt restructuring process. A report published on that date highlighted that private equity firms

KKR

and

York Capital

were set to acquire

100% control

of BLT through a

debt-to-equity swap

. This move was part of a broader restructuring strategy aimed at stabilizing the company's financial position. (

)

However, this plan encountered legal challenges. A group of Indonesian companies filed a lawsuit in the Central Jakarta District Court opposing BLT's restructuring plan, known locally as the

PKPU (Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang)

. The plaintiffs sought to annul the court-approved restructuring agreement, although specific reasons for the opposition were not disclosed in BLT's filings to the Singapore Exchange. (

seafarersrights.org

)

These events marked a critical juncture in BLT's efforts to navigate its financial difficulties, reflecting both the complexities of international debt restructuring and the challenges posed by stakeholder opposition.

If you need further details on the legal proceedings or the implications of the debt-to-equity swap, feel free to ask.

Why It Mattered

◇ It tested the boundaries of

Indonesia’s PKPU process

in dealing with complex, cross-border debt.

◇ It was among the first large-scale restructurings to

blend Indonesian and international legal mechanisms

.

◇ HHP’s work helped secure

a court-approved restructuring plan

and avoid liquidation.

◇ The case set precedents and demonstrated the growing

sophistication of Indonesian insolvency practice

.

Let me know if you’d like this broken down into a narrative for your HHP book project or want further detail on court rulings or strategy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, that’s correct—and the

juxtaposition of the two cases is quite telling

of the shifting tides in Indonesia’s corporate landscape in the early 2010s.

🧭

Timeline Comparison

📉 From Buyouts to Bankruptcies

• The

Matahari buyout

reflected Indonesia’s strong

consumer growth narrative

and a wave of

private equity optimism

.

• Less than two years later,

BLT’s collapse

was a reminder of the

fragility of companies overexposed to global cycles

(in BLT's case, shipping and dollar-denominated debt).

So yes—BLT’s unraveling began shortly after the resolution of Matahari’s buyout, signaling a

turn in corporate risk awareness

and a shift from the euphoria of expansion to the hard realities of restructuring.

• 2010 Titung on
Matahari
The 2010
Matahari
buyout was groundbreaking in Indonesia not just for its size, but also for its
innovative legal and transactional structure
, which set precedents for private equity deals in emerging markets. Here are the most notable legal innovations:
š§
Use of a Limited Partnership (LP) Structure
• The transaction used a
limited partnership fund structure
offshore, typical of private equity globally but rare in Indonesia at the time.
• This allowed
foreign investors (CVC Asia Pacific)
to participate in a leveraged buyout without directly acquiring a controlling stake in an Indonesian public companyāsidestepping foreign ownership restrictions.
š
Back-to-Back Transactions via Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)
◇ The deal was executed through
a complex series of onshore and offshore SPVs
, enabling control to be transferred without a direct share sale of Matahari itself.
◇ MPPA (a Lippo Group company) sold a stake in
Matahari to a joint venture
that it co-owned with CVC, and then gradually reduced its share.
◇ This kept control nominally in Indonesian hands while giving CVC effective operational and economic control.
š
Innovative Use of Conditional Share Purchase Agreements
◇ The deal structure relied on
conditional share purchase agreements
with detailed pre-closing obligations and governance terms.
◇ These contracts included
call and put options
that allowed phased ownership changes, minimizing regulatory triggers such as mandatory tender offers.
š”ļø
Avoidance of Mandatory Tender Offer (MTO) Triggers
◇ By using
layered ownership
and avoiding direct acquisition of a public company, the deal navigated
OJK (then Bapepam-LK)
rules without triggering a full public tender.
◇ This was controversial, with some critics saying it
sidestepped shareholder protections
, but it remained technically within legal bounds.
āļø
Blending of International and Domestic Governance
◇ The shareholders' agreement incorporated
international-standard investor protections
(drag-along, tag-along, veto rights), which were not yet standard practice in Indonesian M&A.
◇ Yet it also had to remain
compliant with Indonesian corporate law
, requiring creative drafting and jurisdictional coordination.
š§©
Disentangling Real Estate and Retail
◇ The deal separated
Matahariās core retail business from its real estate holdings
, which were kept by Lippo through a different listed entity.
◇ This required
careful asset ring-fencing and restructuring
, including brand licensing and store lease-back arrangementsālegally complex under Indonesian law.
š¬ Summary
The
Matahari
buyout was a landmark for its
legal engineering
, navigating Indonesiaās evolving capital markets, foreign investment restrictions, and regulatory grey zones. It effectively
pioneered private equity playbooks
for structuring control without breaching local ownership rules.
