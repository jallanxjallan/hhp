“Go International”: A National Aspiration in 1990s Indonesia
By the 1990s, Indonesia was recalibrating its place in the world. High-growth economics, liberalization, and urbanization fueled a new sense of national confidence. Parallel cultural expressions—especially in music and media—signaled that Indonesians were not merely followers of global trends, but creators and exporters of them. The “Go International” aspiration—spanning boardrooms and backstages—became both a mindset and a mission, framing a national era of outreach, collaboration, and identity‑making on the world stage.
🌐 Economic Confidence and Openness
•
## Financial liberalization
: In
1989
, Indonesia undertook major deregulation of its banking and investment sectors, which helped spark a decade of sustained growth. Between 1989 and 1997, GDP grew at over 7% annually, and Indonesian firms became more export-oriented and regionally competitive.
•

## Urban middle-class emergence
: This growth created a new aspirational class with the means and motivation to think globally—both in consumer taste and in business ambition.

## Cultural Exposure and Media Globalization
◇
Private television and satellite access
: Also in
1989
, Indonesia licensed its first private television stations, including RCTI and SCTV. These networks introduced a steady stream of international programming—music videos, soap operas, Hollywood films—into the daily lives of Indonesians.
◇
## Affordable satellite receivers
quickly followed, especially in urban centers, allowing many households access to foreign channels. The result was an unprecedented degree of exposure to global pop culture, fashion, entertainment, and advertising.
◇ This media shift coincided with the rise of domestic artists who began producing slick, internationally influenced content—what Jeremy Wallach later called
“fashionable, urban pop supported by the upper-middle class.”
##  Pop Kreatif and Cultural Assertion
◇
Pop kreatif
—a hybrid genre combining Western pop, funk, and jazz with Indonesian musical sensibilities—dominated the airwaves. Artists such as
Fariz RM
,
KLa Project
, and
Chrisye
embodied a polished cosmopolitanism that paralleled Indonesia’s economic confidence.
◇ Their lyrics, sounds, and visuals often suggested modern urban life, global connectivity, and emotional introspection—themes that resonated with a generation looking outward.
◇ This was not mimicry but assertion: a way of saying Indonesia could contribute culturally to the global stage, not just consume it.
🚀 Business, Identity, and International Ambition
◇
## Global networks and partnerships
: Spurred by deregulation, Indonesian firms began forging ties with multinational partners and entering regional markets.
◇
National narrative of modernity
: Government messaging during the New Order reinforced this outward gaze—portraying international integration as a sign of Indonesia’s maturity and progress.
◇ Whether in the launch of a new corporate brand or the styling of a music video, the tone was unmistakable: Indonesia was ready for the world, and the world should be ready for Indonesia.
