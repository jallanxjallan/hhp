### Emergence of NLH (Nico Luntungan & Partners)

In the 1980s, NLH (Nico Luntungan & Partners) emerged as one of Indonesia's pioneering firms in international business law, largely due to the leadership of Nico Luntungan. Luntunganâ€™s innovative vision positioned the firm at the forefront of legal services catering to foreign investments in Indonesia. The firm established itself as a key player in the exploration of legal frameworks that supported foreign investment, joint ventures, and complex matters related to corporate and banking law. During this period, NLH was one of the few Indonesian firms adept at navigating the legal intricacies associated with multinational transactions, enabling it to build a robust reputation in a time when such services were still nascent in the country. Tuti Hadiputranto was associated with the firm during this pivotal time, contributing to the development of legal expertise in an evolving business landscape.

### Tuti Hadiputranto and Nasution Lubis

In the 1980s, Tuti Hadiputranto was part of the original team at Nasution Lubis, working alongside notable figures like Adnan Buyung Nasution and Todung Mulya Lubis. This firm was distinctive as it engaged in high-level legal reform while providing corporate advisory services, positioning itself as one of the few Indonesian legal practices capable of embracing both advocacy and commercial law. Hadiputranto's experiences at Nasution Lubis provided her with insight into the pressing legal challenges facing Indonesia at the time and the transformative role that law could play in broader societal reform.

Transitioning from the public interest-oriented framework of Nasution Lubis to the more corporate-focused environment of her subsequent firm, Hadiputrantoâ€™s career reflects a significant shift in Indonesian legal practice during the late Suharto period. This period was marked by a gradual movement away from grassroots advocacy and legal reform towards the establishment of full-service commercial law firms with international affiliations, such as Hadiputranto and Partners (HHP). This transition underscored a changing legal landscape that increasingly prioritized corporate interests over public advocacy.

### Emergence of LHGS (Lubis, Hadiputranto, Gunawan & Suharto)

LHGS (Lubis, Hadiputranto, Gunawan & Suharto) emerged in the 1980s as a notable local firm with substantial strengths in corporate, regulatory, and finance work. Before the eventual fragmentation of the firm, LHGS was recognized as a leading player in Indonesiaâ€™s legal market, adeptly handling a variety of complex legal matters and establishing standards of excellence in legal services. The partners at LHGS, including Tuti Hadiputranto, played pivotal roles in the firmâ€™s development, which later enabled them to establish new firms that became dominant forces in the marketplace, including HHP and Lubis Santosa.

### HHD (Hiswara Bunjamin & Tandjung)

Founded in the late 1990s, HHD (Hiswara Bunjamin & Tandjung) is recognized as a prominent legal firm in Indonesiaâ€™s landscape. Affiliated with Herbert Smith Freehills, HHD has carved a niche for itself, focusing on high-end mergers and acquisitions, banking, and dispute resolution. Its profile as an elite boutique has been reinforced by a solid reputation for advising global financial institutions and multinationals, reflecting the evolving demands of an increasingly complex legal environment in Indonesia. The firm's expertise in high-stakes legal matters has established it as a go-to advisor in the region, highlighting the growth and professionalization of the Indonesian legal sector in the 2010s.
