1. This prompt covers the backstory of HHP, focusing on Tuti Hadriputrantoâ€™s experiences in Indonesian law firms prior to founding the firm. Write clear, fact-based summaries from Tuti's point of view in the third person describing the professional environment she encountered, the structural and cultural challenges she observed, and the formative insights that shaped her vision for a new kind of legal practice. The tone should remain objective and descriptive, laying the groundwork for later discussion of institutional reform and professionalization.
