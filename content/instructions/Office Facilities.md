This prompt covers the evolution of HHP’s physical footprint—its offices, law library, and other facilities—throughout the years.
Write factually grounded passages, but feel free to adopt a looser tone that allows for light editorializing or colorful description where appropriate (e.g., referring to the first office as “a glorified shophouse”).
These passages should convey not just what the spaces were, but what they signified about the firm’s growth, ambition, and working culture at each stage.
Use a tone that is professional and strategic, suitable for an international audience interested in the firm’s evolution and workspace innovation.
