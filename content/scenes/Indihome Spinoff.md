Explain how the firm provided legal counsel throughout the separation process, helping to navigate regulatory hurdles, corporate structuring, and asset transfers. Highlight the significance of the deal in Indonesiaâ€™s digital infrastructure landscape, particularly in positioning Indihome for strategic growth and partnerships. Mention that HHPâ€™s work on this transaction was recognized with an ALB (Asian Legal Business) award, underscoring the firmâ€™s leadership in handling sophisticated corporate restructuring and telecom sector transactions. The tone should be authoritative and informative, suitable for a professional readership familiar with regional business developments.
