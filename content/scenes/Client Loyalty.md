# Client Loyalty

## Manuscript

(Write your draft here...)

---

## Prompt

Explain the importance of client loyalty in a hyper-competitive legal environment where price competition can erode service quality. Emphasize that client loyalty serves as a counterbalance to the “race to the bottom” on fees by rewarding firms that deliver consistent, efficient service rather than just the lowest quote. Note that long-term client retention allows for streamlined onboarding of new lawyers and reduced inefficiencies, as both sides share a history of expectations, internal protocols, and case background.
Assert that HHP’s high levels of client loyalty—even as partners and associates transition—demonstrate the strength of its institutional framework and its ability to maintain excellence across generations of legal talent.
