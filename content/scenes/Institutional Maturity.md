# Institutional Maturity

## Manuscript

(Write your draft here...)

## Prompt

 Discuss how by the time of Tuti Hadiputrantoâ€™s retirement in 2016, HHP had evolved into a fully mature legal institution. Emphasize that while she had been a founding figure and a vital influence in shaping the firmâ€™s culture and direction, HHP was no longer dependent on any single individual for its continued success. Describe how the firm had institutionalized its leadership, diversified its areas of expertise, and built a deep bench of partners and associates capable of sustaining its reputation and operations. Highlight the systems, mentoring practices, and succession planning that enabled HHP to transition smoothly beyond its founding generation. The tone should be reflective and authoritative, suitable for readers interested in law firm governance and organizational longevity.
