## Prompt

Write a narrative passage from HHPâ€™s perspective in the early 1990s, when the firm consisted of just five lawyers and two consultants. Describe how, despite its small size, HHP positioned itself to effectively serve foreign clients by leveraging institutional backing and strategic affiliations. Emphasize how access to broader legal networks, regulatory insights, and shared knowledge resources allowed the firm to offer international-standard representation. Highlight how this approach enabled HHP to collaborate with larger firms when needed, build credibility, and deliver robust legal strategies suited to complex cross-border matters. Show how this integration of global support with local expertise helped establish HHP as a trusted partner for foreign investors navigating Indonesiaâ€™s evolving legal environment.
