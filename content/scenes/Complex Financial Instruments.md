1. Explain how, in the years following the Asian Financial Crisis, the use of complex financial instruments such as derivatives, currency swaps, and structured notes became increasingly common in Indonesia as companies sought tools to hedge risk and manage exposure.
2. Describe how this financial evolution presented both legal and practical challenges, particularly due to a lack of familiarity among regulators, clients, and even the courts with these instruments.
3. Highlight how HHP played a dual roleâ€”first as legal advisor, and second as educatorâ€”helping clients understand not only the mechanics of derivatives but also their proper legal treatment, risk implications, and contractual safeguards.
4. Note that much of HHPâ€™s early litigation work in this area involved simplifying and defending these transactions before courts unfamiliar with international financial standards, essentially navigating a legal and financial frontier.
5. Emphasize that this experience cemented HHPâ€™s reputation as a pioneer in financial law, bridging gaps between global practice and Indonesian legal infrastructure.
