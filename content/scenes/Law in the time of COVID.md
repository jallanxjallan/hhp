## Prompt

Describe how HHP adapted its operations during the COVID-19 lockdown, noting that its new offices remained largely empty for nearly two years.
Explain how the firm used the disruption as an opportunity to rethink the delivery of legal services, including remote collaboration, digital workflows, and client interface.
Note that these adjustments allowed HHP to streamline internal processes and emerge from the pandemic period as a leaner, more resilient, and more efficient organization.
