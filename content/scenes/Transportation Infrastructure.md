MRT showcased HHP role in creating legal framework of major infrastructure projects
HHP played a key advisory role in structuring the legal and regulatory frameworks for two of Indonesiaâ€™s most ambitious infrastructure projects: the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and the Jakartaâ€“Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR).
For the MRT, HHP advised the Jakarta city-owned enterprise PT MRT Jakarta on procurement, construction contracts, land acquisition issues, and Japanese ODA (Official Development Assistance) loan financing, which was facilitated through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
The firm provided strategic counsel on the application of FIDIC-based contracts and compliance with Indonesian procurement law, helping harmonize international financing terms with domestic regulatory requirements.
In the case of the Jakartaâ€“Bandung High Speed Rail, HHP advised PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN Indonesia (PSBI)â€”a consortium of four Indonesian state-owned enterprisesâ€”on aspects of the joint venture with China Railway International, which included equity contributions, governance, and debt financing.
HHPâ€™s work also encompassed regulatory analysis for the use of Chinese concessional loans and alignment with Presidential Regulation No. 107/2015, which authorized the HSR project without reliance on state budget funds.
By advising both public and private stakeholders, HHP helped navigate issues of land use, state asset transfer, cross-border risk allocation, and government support instruments, setting precedents for future infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia.
