## Prompt

On 1 February 2021, Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI) was officially launched, marking the merger of three state-owned Islamic banks: BRI Syariah, BNI Syariah, and Bank Syariah Mandiri.
Initiated by a government directive to consolidate the sector, the merger aimed to enhance financial inclusion and establish a globally competitive Islamic banking institution.
HHP was appointed as lead counsel to advise on legal strategy, regulatory compliance, and execution of the merger, which involved navigating multiple overlapping legal frameworks.
The integration posed unique challengesâ€”merging different IT platforms, governance models, and corporate culturesâ€”while ensuring full compliance with Islamic legal principles.
HHPâ€™s role included managing dual oversight by Indonesiaâ€™s Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the National Syariah Board (DSN-MUI), ensuring that the transaction adhered to both civil and Shariah law.
The BSI merger, now Indonesiaâ€™s largest Islamic bank by assets, stands as a national milestone and a precedent for future consolidations in the Islamic finance sector.
