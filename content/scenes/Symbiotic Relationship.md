## Prompt

Explain how for top-tier firms like HHP, client relationships are not merely transactional but symbiotic and co-dependent, with both sides investing in shared expertise, trust, and strategy.
Reference legal profession research showing that in-house and external counsel thrive in mutual collaboration, often described as an advisor-client-market triad that co-evolves over time.
Highlight that active relationship management and ethical foundations are core to this dynamic, with elite firms building deep industry knowledge, integrating legal-ops approaches, and ensuring clients see them as strategic allies rather than vendors.
Draw on insights from sources such as Forbes, Harvardâ€™s Center on the Legal Profession, Fordham Law Review, and Reuters surveys on the imperative for active relationship management in elite law firms.
