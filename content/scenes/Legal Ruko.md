## Prompt

Describe how HHPâ€™s first office in 1990 was a modest, sub-leased spaceâ€”reportedly in or near the Landmark building in South Jakartaâ€”shared by five lawyers and three consultants working in a single open-plan room.
Note that the only enclosed space was a pre-existing glass cashierâ€™s booth, where Tuti and Tuti Dewi signed documents through a small counter window, visible to anyone who entered.
Emphasize the do-it-yourself ethos of the founding team: desks, typewriters, early-model computers, and even portable plastic hawker chairs were personally brought in and assembled by the lawyers and consultants themselves.
Highlight how this informal, transparent setup allowed clients to see the entire team in action immediately upon arrival, creating an atmosphere of energy and accountability.
Conclude that despite these humble physical conditions, HHPâ€™s strong sense of teamwork, shared purpose, and determination to become one of Jakartaâ€™s top firms laid the foundation for its rapid growth and long-term success.

## Result 1756452753

In 1990, HHP's first office could be best described as a modest, perhaps even charmingly scrappy setupâ€”located within or adjacent to the Landmark building in South Jakarta, it was a space that encapsulated the firmâ€™s early ambitions and resilient spirit. Picture, if you will, a glorified shophouse where five dedicated lawyers and three industrious consultants shared a single, open-plan room. This wasn't an epitome of luxury; rather, it was a practical, collaborative environment that underscored the firm's do-it-yourself ethos. 

The only semblance of privacy came from a pre-existing glass cashierâ€™s booth, where Tuti and Tuti Dewi would sign documents through a small counter window. This configuration was not merely a quirk; it epitomized transparency, as every client who entered was greeted by the sight of the entire team in action. The hustle and bustle of legal discussions, the clatter of early-model computers and typewriters, and the sight of portable plastic hawker chairsâ€”all personally carted in and assembled by the lawyers and consultantsâ€”created an atmosphere ripe with energy and accountability.

This informal workspace not only fostered close-knit collaboration but also reflected a dedication to client service. Clients could immediately sense the vigor and commitment of the team, reinforcing trust and confidence in HHPâ€™s capabilities. Despite their humble physical conditions, the founding teamâ€™s strong sense of teamwork, shared purpose, and unwavering determination to establish HHP as a prominent legal player in Jakarta was palpable. The foundations laid during those formative years would propel the firm into a trajectory of rapid growth and long-lasting success, transforming aspirations into reality one case at a time.
