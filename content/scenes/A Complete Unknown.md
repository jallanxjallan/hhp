# A Complete Unknown

## Prompt

Explain how, prior to deregulation, the Indonesian legal environment was shaped by law firms built around charismatic, well-connected senior partners whose personal relationships with government officials and business elites were often more important than institutional reputation or technical legal skill.
Describe how this personality-driven system suited the local business culture but proved unattractive or inaccessible to most foreign investors, who sought transparent, reliable institutions rather than informal personal channels.
Note that only the highest tier of foreign investorsâ€”typically those concluding deals directly with President Soeharto and the inner circle of his New Order regimeâ€”were comfortable operating in this relationship-based system.
