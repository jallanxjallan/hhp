## Prompt

Describe the challenge HHP faced in the 2000s when Indonesian judges often lacked the specialized expertise required to adjudicate complex financial cases, especially those involving derivatives, fiduciary arrangements, or structured lending instruments.
Explain how HHP responded by meticulously crafting their litigation strategy to “box in” judges—structuring arguments with such legal and factual precision that judges were left with only a narrow range of rulings under prevailing laws and precedents.
Emphasize that this technique did not guarantee a favorable outcome, but ensured that any decision rendered would be grounded in law and established precedent rather than judicial guesswork or improvisation.
Note that by eliminating ambiguity and aligning their submissions with prior rulings and statutory interpretation, HHP helped elevate the quality of judicial reasoning in financial cases and reinforced institutional respect for rule-based adjudication.
Highlight that this approach exemplifies HHP’s commitment not just to winning cases, but to building a stronger, more predictable legal system in Indonesia.
