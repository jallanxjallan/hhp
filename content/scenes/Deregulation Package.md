â€œIn October 1988, the Suharto government unveiled a sweeping financial reform package with the explicit goal of liberalizing the banking and financial system. Among its key provisions were:
The removal of restrictions on establishing new private banks, along with the expansion of foreign bank branches and joint-venture operations 
The lifting of subsidized interestâ€‘rate ceilings and credit quotas, and transition to open-market operations under Bank Indonesiaâ€™s control
The imposition of prudential measuresâ€”such as single-borrower lending limitsâ€”to enhance banking stability
By March 1989, a follow-up refinement package further strengthened supervision, introduced netâ€‘openâ€‘position controls on foreign borrowing, and permitted up to 99â€¯percent foreign ownership in Indonesianâ€‘listed banks

During the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s, HHP faced significant challenges as a result of the economic downturn that impacted Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The firmâ€™s response involved a series of internal measures and strategic adaptations tailored to navigate this turbulent period.

One of the initial steps HHP took was to reassess its operational structure to enhance efficiency in responding to the crisis's unique demands. The firm streamlined its internal processes, emphasizing cross-departmental collaboration to facilitate quicker decision-making and better resource allocation. This restructuring aimed to reduce costs while maintaining service quality, crucial amid declining client budgets and project delays.

Client work during the crisis primarily shifted towards crisis management and restructuring services. Many clients were reeling from the financial upheaval, with firms facing insolvency, debt overhangs, and severe cash flow issues. HHP's legal team adapted by providing specialized support in negotiations with creditors, offering strategic advice on debt restructuring, and assisting with compliance to rapidly shifting regulatory requirements. 

The firm also had to confront challenges arising from falling demand for its usual advisory and transactional services. Clients had increasingly put expansion plans on hold, and there was a noticeable decline in mergers and acquisitions, primarily due to uncertainty in the financial markets. In response, HHP reoriented its expertise towards financial litigation and dispute resolution, helping clients navigate the complexities arising from defaults and breaches of contract.

Moreover, HHP recognized the need to enhance its understanding of risk management. As banking reforms implemented by the Indonesian government in the late 1980s started to evolve, the firm, despite facing the brunt of the crisis, committed to staying updated with the changes in financial regulations stemming from these policies. This focus enabled HHP to provide relevant advice tailored to the new financial landscape characterized by increased foreign participation and precautionary measures intended to stabilize the banking sector.

In conclusion, HHP's response to the Asian Financial Crisis involved a strategic pivot towards internal efficiency, an emphasis on crisis-related client services, and a keen adaptation to regulatory changes. These measures not only helped the firm weather the immediate impacts of the economic downturn but also laid the groundwork for resilience and recovery in the years that followed.
