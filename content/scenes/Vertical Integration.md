## Prompt

Explain that while HHP initially built its reputation on regulatory advice, transactional structuring, and legislative drafting, its decision to establish dedicated litigation and arbitration departments—more than a decade after founding—was strategic, not reactive.
Note that this move followed the advice of a foreign legal consultant who observed that Indonesia’s maturing legal system and the growing complexity of commercial disputes created an opportunity for firms with deep subject-matter knowledge to shape outcomes in court, not just on paper.
Emphasize that disputes were increasingly arising from the very agreements HHP had helped to structure—especially in areas like finance, infrastructure, and cross-border investment—making it both logical and efficient for the firm to represent clients throughout the entire lifecycle of a deal, including its enforcement or defense.
Describe how HHP’s entry into dispute resolution allowed it to safeguard the legal integrity of its earlier work, apply its regulatory insight in adversarial contexts, and provide continuity for clients navigating both preventive and reactive legal strategies.
Conclude that “joining the fight” in court or arbitration was not a departure from HHP’s advisory ethos, but an extension of it—ensuring that well-constructed agreements could be defended with equal sophistication when challenged.
