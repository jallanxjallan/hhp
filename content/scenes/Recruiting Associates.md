## Prompt

Explain how HHP approaches recruitment, with an emphasis on attracting top legal talent from both the University of Indonesiaâ€”widely regarded as the country's most prestigious law schoolâ€”and other top-ranked regional universities across the archipelago. Highlight the firmâ€™s commitment to promoting diversity in legal thinking by actively seeking qualified applicants from outside Java. Describe how this inclusive recruitment strategy strengthens the firm by bringing a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and regional insights to client service. The tone should be professional and forward-looking, suitable for an international audience interested in legal sector best practices and diversity initiatives in Southeast Asia.
