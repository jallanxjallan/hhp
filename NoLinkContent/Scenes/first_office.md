1. Describe how HHPâ€™s first office in 1990 was a modest, sub-leased spaceâ€”reportedly in or near the Landmark building in South Jakartaâ€”shared by five lawyers and three consultants working in a single open-plan room.
2. Note that the only enclosed space was a pre-existing glass cashierâ€™s booth, where Tuti and Tuti Dewi signed documents through a small counter window, visible to anyone who entered.
3. Emphasize the do-it-yourself ethos of the founding team: desks, typewriters, early-model computers, and even portable plastic hawker chairs were personally brought in and assembled by the lawyers and consultants themselves.
4. Highlight how this informal, transparent setup allowed clients to see the entire team in action immediately upon arrival, creating an atmosphere of energy and accountability.
5. Conclude that despite these humble physical conditions, HHPâ€™s strong sense of teamwork, shared purpose, and determination to become one of Jakartaâ€™s top firms laid the foundation for its rapid growth and long-term success.
