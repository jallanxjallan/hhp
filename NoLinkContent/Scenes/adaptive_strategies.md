1. Describe how HHP Law Firm adapted to the severe disruptions caused by the Asian Financial Crisis, particularly the sharp loss of client activity as bankruptcies mounted and corporate transactions slowed. Focus on how the firm responded to the contraction of its traditional client baseâ€”many of whom were local conglomerates or businesses heavily exposed to foreign debtâ€”by pivoting strategically.
2. Explain how HHP restructured internally to preserve institutional strength, including reassessing staffing levels, rebalancing workload distribution, and streamlining operational costs without compromising core capabilities. Emphasize the firm's agility in shifting focus toward emerging opportunities: supporting export-oriented companies, assisting clients with debt restructuring and insolvency proceedings, and advising a new wave of foreign investors seeking undervalued assets.
3. Highlight how this period tested HHPâ€™s institutional foundations and validated its long-term investments in legal infrastructure, specialization, and cross-border expertise. Despite the crisis, these adaptive strategies helped the firm not only survive but reinforce its resilienceâ€”cementing its position as a leading corporate law firm in Indonesia.
