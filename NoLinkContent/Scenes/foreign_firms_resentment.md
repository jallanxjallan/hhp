1.  Describe how Indonesiaâ€™s economic liberalization in the 1990sâ€”particularly the surge in direct foreign investment and regulatory changes allowing offshore borrowing in foreign currenciesâ€”transformed the legal landscape. Explain how this internationalization led to an influx of foreign lawyers, often in consultancy roles, within major Indonesian firms. Highlight the resulting tension within the local legal community, as many Indonesian firms resented what they saw as encroachment by foreign consultants. Focus on how HHP, as one of the most prominent and internationally connected firms, bore the brunt of this resentment. Include how the firm navigated this period of transition and what steps it took to maintain its reputation and client base amid rising professional scrutiny. Use a tone that is analytical and balanced, aimed at readers interested in the evolution of professional services in emerging markets.
