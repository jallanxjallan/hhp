1. This prompt covers the backstory of HHP, focusing on Tuti Hadriputrantoâ€™s experiences in Indonesian law firms prior to founding the firm. Write clear, fact-based summaries that outline the professional environment she encountered, the structural and cultural challenges she observed, and the formative insights that shaped her vision for a new kind of legal practice. The tone should remain objective and descriptive, laying the groundwork for later discussion of institutional reform and professionalization.
