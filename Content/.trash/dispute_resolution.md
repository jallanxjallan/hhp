1.  Describe how HHP approaches dispute resolution, especially in the context of high-end finance. Emphasize that legal representation in major financial transactions often leads to complex disputes, but that HHP has a clear internal policy of prioritizing negotiated solutions over litigation whenever possible. Illustrate how this aligns with a broader Indonesian tradition of compromise and consensus-building. Highlight specific strategies the firm uses to resolve disputes early√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùsuch as pre-trial negotiations, mediation, or arbitration√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand explain how this approach protects client interests, preserves business relationships, and reduces reputational risk. The tone should be professional but accessible, suitable for an international audience unfamiliar with Indonesian legal culture.
