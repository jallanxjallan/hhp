Tuti knew from experience that Indonesian firms built around  [dominant personalities](stories/dominant_personalites.md) would not satisfy foreign clients who prefer to deal with established institutions. [Tuti's vision](stories/vision_and_mission.md) of a corporate law firm greater than the sum of its parts led to the [establishment](stories/hhp_founded.md) of HHP.
