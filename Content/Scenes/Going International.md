1. Write a narrative passage describing how the phrase ‚ÄúGo International‚Äù captured the spirit of early 1990s Indonesia. Situate this aspiration within the context of 1989 financial deregulation, rising economic confidence, and increased exposure to international culture via private television stations and satellite broadcasts. Highlight how this new openness shaped both popular culture (e.g. the rise of internationally influenced Indonesian pop music) and business ambition. Emphasize the sense of emerging national confidence and the growing belief that Indonesians could succeed on the global stage‚Äîboth creatively and commercially.
