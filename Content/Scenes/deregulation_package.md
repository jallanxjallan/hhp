2. The removal of restrictions on establishing new private banks, along with the expansion of foreign bank branches and joint-venture operations
3. The lifting of subsidized interestâ€‘rate ceilings and credit quotas, and transition to open-market operations under Bank Indonesiaâ€™s control
4. The imposition of prudential measuresâ€”such as single-borrower lending limitsâ€”to enhance banking stability
5. By March 1989, a follow-up refinement package further strengthened supervision, introduced netâ€‘openâ€‘position controls on foreign borrowing, and permitted up to 99â€¯percent foreign ownership in Indonesianâ€‘listed banks
