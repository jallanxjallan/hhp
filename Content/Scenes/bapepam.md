1. Introduce Indonesia’s 1990s capital markets as the “Wild East”—a period of rapid financial expansion marked by immense opportunity but little regulatory structure, echoing the unpredictability of America’s “Wild West.” In this unruly yet promising landscape, only a handful of legal and financial experts were advising the government on how to build a stable, rules-based system.
2. Among these, HHP Law Firm stood out not only for its legal expertise but because it was fronted by Indonesians—offering a rare combination of technical capability and deep cultural and institutional understanding. While foreign consultants also played important roles—many with longstanding ties to Indonesia and genuine commitment to its development—HHP’s Indonesian leadership brought a unique perspective that helped bridge local realities with emerging global norms.
3. Emphasize how, through work with regulatory bodies such as Bapepam, HHP contributed to the drafting of early capital market regulations, helping to bring clarity and order to an unpredictable financial frontier and supporting Indonesia’s transition toward a more credible and investable market economy.
