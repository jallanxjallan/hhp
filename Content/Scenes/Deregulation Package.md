[[Financial Deregulation#Pakto88]]
1. “In October 1988, the Suharto government unveiled a sweeping financial reform package with the explicit goal of liberalizing the banking and financial system. Among its key provisions were:
2. The removal of restrictions on establishing new private banks, along with the expansion of foreign bank branches and joint-venture operations 
3. The lifting of subsidized interest‑rate ceilings and credit quotas, and transition to open-market operations under Bank Indonesia’s control
4. The imposition of prudential measures—such as single-borrower lending limits—to enhance banking stability
5. By March 1989, a follow-up refinement package further strengthened supervision, introduced net‑open‑position controls on foreign borrowing, and permitted up to 99 percent foreign ownership in Indonesian‑listed banks
