Add long-standing clients here.

1. Explain the importance of client loyalty in a hyper-competitive legal environment where price competition can erode service quality.
2. Emphasize that client loyalty serves as a counterbalance to the “race to the bottom” on fees by rewarding firms that deliver consistent, efficient service rather than just the lowest quote.
3. Define client loyalty as the complement of institutionalization: while institutionalization ensures continuity of legal knowledge and case experience regardless of individual turnover, client loyalty reflects the client’s trust in that institutional continuity.
4. Note that long-term client retention allows for streamlined onboarding of new lawyers and reduced inefficiencies, as both sides share a history of expectations, internal protocols, and case background.
5. Assert that HHP’s high levels of client loyalty—even as partners and associates transition—demonstrate the strength of its institutional framework and its ability to maintain excellence across generations of legal talent.
