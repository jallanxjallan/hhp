1. Lay out the backstory of the Asian Financial Crisis as it unfolded across Southeast Asia in 1997–1998, with particular focus on Indonesia. Begin with Thailand’s decision in mid-1997 to float the baht, triggering a loss of investor confidence across the region. Describe how capital flight, collapsing currencies, and plunging stock markets turned a currency wobble into a full-blown economic contagion affecting the so-called “Asian Tigers.”
2. Explain that Indonesia was among the hardest hit. For years, its rapid growth had been fueled by liberalization, foreign investment, and easy access to U.S. dollar-denominated credit. When the rupiah collapsed—from around 2,500 to over 15,000 to the dollar in just a few months—the debt burden became unsustainable. The financial system crumbled, large conglomerates defaulted, and unemployment soared.
3. Highlight how the crisis revealed structural flaws in the Indonesian economy: poor corporate governance, weak and underregulated banks, and dangerous overdependence on short-term foreign capital. Detail the arrival of the IMF, whose bailout came with harsh reform conditions. Note the social and political consequences—including mass protests, deadly riots, and the resignation of President Suharto in May 1998 after 32 years in power.
