1. In 1994, Telkom Indonesia launched one of the most ambitious public offerings in Southeast Asia, marking a turning point in the privatization and modernization of state-owned enterprises. The IPO was conducted simultaneously on the Jakarta and New York stock exchanges and was hailed as a landmark in Indonesiaâ€™s financial historyâ€”garnering official recognition in the Indonesian Book of Records (MURI) for its scale and complexity. The offering signaled the country's commitment to transparency, global capital access, and economic reform. While HHP was already active in capital markets work during this period, public sources do not currently confirm the firmâ€™s direct involvement in the Telkom IPO.
