humble background

Year End / New Year Parties – We work hard, we play hard (after the work is done, of course). We are professionals at work. We are also “pros” in entertaining ourselves, helping each other keep our sanity in tact. Sometimes, this means insanely fun parties to end the year or to start the year.

nniversary Celebrations – Each year we celebrate HHP’s anniversary. Sometimes it’s a grandeur celebration at a fancy establishment where we dress up. Sometimes it’s a simple, modest yet meaningful and intimate “syukuran” in the office. But every time, the Tumpeng is never to be missed.

Internal fun bonding events (as HHPers) since the beginning of the firm establishment. Although by now they 'somewhat' are no longer low-budget

Office Outings – Awani (cruise – this should be before 1999), Bali (so many times – there should be one where it was kind of amazing race, i.e., bike riding through ubud, then end up somewhere where we have to do some sort of performance), Bandung (this might be Lawyers Retreat instead of Office Outing), Yogya 1st time (2005?), Lombok (bubar karena hujan), Belitung, Yogya 2nd time (featuring naik kereta wisata for lucky group of people who managed to secure registration).

SIH, TS, WW…
