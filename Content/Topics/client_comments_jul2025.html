</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1989, a government deregulation package set the stage for
increased foreign investment. This created a demand for
international-standard legal services.</p>
<p>At the time, most Indonesian law firms were built around dominant
personalities. Tuti Hadiputranto, who had been an associate in several
such firms, realized that foreign investors planning long-term
commitments preferred legal institutions over individual lawyers. Tuti’s
vision of a corporate law firm greater than the sum of its parts led to
the establishment of HHP.</p>
<p>HHP began modestly, with an office barely better than a shop-house
floor. Nevertheless, the firm quickly rose to prominence in the Jakarta
legal landscape, becoming the first local firm to “go international” by
joining the Baker McKenzie global alliance—a network of independent law
firms specializing in cross-border transactions and dispute
resolution.</p>

<p>Indosat was the first Indonesian company to list on both the Jakarta
and New York stock exchanges. This was HHP’s first foray into major
international finance. By then, the firm had moved into spacious
quarters in a landmark building. As the legal profession struggled to

<p><strong>4. Navigating the Asian Financial Crisis</strong></p>
<p>In late 1998, <mark>a meeting in an upmarket hotel nearly erupted
into physical violence when an client negotiator told the CEO of an
insolvent Jakarta taxi company that bankruptcy was the only viable
option.**</mark> [Note: Please refer to the comment and recording for
the story account, and assess whether it is suitable as a reference for
this situation.] Over the following years, similar—if less
dramatic—encounters occurred as once-thriving companies faltered under
the weight of the Asian Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>But a substantial number of cases had more positive outcomes, as HHP
skillfully employed its deep expertise in international finance and
negotiation to restructure crushing debts. As chief legal advisor to
IBRA, HHP played a critical role in restoring confidence in Indonesia’s
banking sector during the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Through strategic adaptation, HHP—like many well-managed,
internationally oriented clients—not only weathered the crisis but
emerged stronger. At the turn of the millennium, the firm moved into
Jakarta’s most prestigious commercial address: the Stock Exchange
Building.</p>
