1. This collection of prompts documents key milestones in HHP’s development, from its founding to the present. Write concise, factual summaries of significant events, decisions, and institutional changes. Assume continuity from previous text—people, places, and entities already introduced do not need full reintroduction. Maintain an objective tone and chronological structure, suitable for later narrative interpretation.
