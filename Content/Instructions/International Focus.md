1. This prompt focuses on HHPâ€™s work with international clients and its participation in global legal networks. Write a factual passage describing how the firm positioned itself to serve foreign investors, multinationals, or cross-border transactions, and how it built or joined international networks to support that work. Include relevant developments such as affiliations, referrals, or institutional relationships. The tone should be objective and informative, laying the groundwork for later discussion of globalization and professional standards.
