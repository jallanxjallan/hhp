1. This prompt explores the theory and practice of institutionalizing a law firm, with HHP as the primary case. Write a clear, explanatory passage that defines key concepts—such as knowledge-sharing, succession planning, or process standardization—and describes how these principles were applied (or challenged) in practice. The tone should be thoughtful and analytical, bridging abstract ideas with concrete examples from HHP’s development. This passage is intended to clarify what it means to build a firm that endures beyond individual reputations.
