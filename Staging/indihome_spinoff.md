1.  Describe HHPâ€™s role in the spinoff of Indihome from PT Telkom Indonesia, one of the countryâ€™s most complex and high-profile telecom restructurings. Explain how the firm provided legal counsel throughout the separation process, helping to navigate regulatory hurdles, corporate structuring, and asset transfers. Highlight the significance of the deal in Indonesiaâ€™s digital infrastructure landscape, particularly in positioning Indihome for strategic growth and partnerships. Mention that HHPâ€™s work on this transaction was recognized with an ALB (Asian Legal Business) award, underscoring the firmâ€™s leadership in handling sophisticated corporate restructuring and telecom sector transactions. The tone should be authoritative and informative, suitable for a professional readership familiar with regional business developments.
