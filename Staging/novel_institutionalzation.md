1. Take a deeper dive into the concept of *institutionalization* in the context of a law firm, particularly within the Indonesian legal sector of the 1990s. Explain how institutionalization involves the development of formal internal structures, standardized processes, and a collective identity that ensures the firmâ€™s sustainability beyond any one individual. Highlight how this contrasts with earlier models in Indonesia, where legal practice was often defined by the stature or networks of a founding partner.
3. Explore how, during this period, institutionalization meant more than internal efficiencyâ€”it became a strategic response to globalizing markets, rising client expectations, and the need for professional credibility. Examine key elements such as internal governance, client management systems, associate career tracks, and branding strategies that signaled a firmâ€™s shift from a personality-driven practice to a durable, collaborative institution. Anchor the discussion in the broader transformation of Indonesian law firms during the 1990s as they positioned themselves to serve increasingly complex domestic and international corporate needs.
