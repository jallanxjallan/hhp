# 1. Visionary Beginnings

In 1989, a government [deregulation package](stories/deregulation_package.md) created a demand for  [international-standard legal services.](stories/international_standards.md). [Tuti Hadriputranto](stories/tuti_h.md) knew from experience that Indonesian firms built around [dominant personalities](stories/dominant_personalites.md) would not satisfy foreign clients wanting to [engage legal institutions](stories/clients_want_institutions.md) for [protecting their investments](stories/protecting_investments.md).  [Tuti's vision](stories/vision_and_mission.md) of a corporate law firm greater than the sum of its parts led to the [establishment](stories/hpp_founded.md) of HHP.  The [first office](stories/first_office.md)  was little better than a shop-house floor. 

‚ßâ Tuti's experience at precursor firms [NLH](), [LHGS](), [HH](), and [HHD]() forged her vision for HHP.

# 4. Navigating the Asian Financial Crisis 

Physical violence at a bankruptcy negotiation with a  [Jakarta taxi company](stories/steady_safe_taxi.md) showed the devastating effects of the [Asian Financial Crisis](stories/asian_financial_crisis.md).

HHP expanded scope through establishing departments for  a [litigation](stories/setting_up_litigation.md) and [arbitration](stories/arbitration.md). The firm itself embarked on a process of reinvention, [formalizing institutional polices](stories/committing_to_an_institution.md) to [manage internal conflicts](stories/managing_conflicts.md) and provide clear guidelines for [mentoring a new generation](stories/professional_development.md) of legal talent.

# 7. Changing of the Guard  

In 2015, HHP proved itself as the dominant player in international corporate law with the restructuring of the  [Berlian Laju](stories/berlian_laju_tanker.md).  But this high-water mark was also an inflection point for the firm. As the founding partners [neared retirement age](stories/retirement_and_succession.md), the commitment to institutionalization was being put to the test. This was the ultimate test of [client loyalty](stories/client_loyalty.md).

# 8. An Indonesian Firm

Though HHP is widely regarded as the most-international of top-tier legal profession, the firm remains steadfast to Indonesian cultural and social roots. This served the firm well in handling the controversial [Freeport](stories/freeport_divestment.md) divestment, and the promotion of [Green Sukuk](stories/green_sukuk.md) investment products, an expression of Indonesian religious and cultural values.

# 9. Modernization and Technological Adaptation 

In 2015, three decades after the Telkom IPO secured HHP's place in the first ranks the legal profession, the [spin-off of Indihome](stories/telkom_spinoff.md) marked the firm's entry into the new worlds of digital services  while winning the ALB M&A Deal of the Year award. The firm moved to the brand new [Pacific Century building](stories/pacific_century.md), the most technologically advanced commercial structure in the city. But the sleek new offices stood largely empty for two years as the COVID pandemic raged. The firm used this challenging time to rethink the process of performing legal functions, streamlining operations and embracing remote to emerge leaner and more efficient. 

# 10.  New Legal Frontiers

In another Deal of the Year, in 2021 HPP facilitated a sizable investment by a global venture capital fund in [Vingroup](stories/kkr_investment.md), a Vietnam-based company on the forefront of the transition to clean energy. As that company's fleet of all-electric taxis cruise Jakarta streets, HHP is also on the forefront of fintech and other digital technologies, drawing on the firm's commitment to nurturing a culturally diverse, highly trained coterie of associates and skilled support staff to draw on decades of institutional knowledge and a staff with [world-class skills](stories/world_class_local_skills.md) to guide clients and colleges navigate an exciting, unpredictable future. HHP is also not neglecting common Indonesians. The merger of [three Islamic Banks](stories/bsi_merger.md) will help to mobilize investment in traditionally underserved rural sectors.
