1. This prompt highlights the lighter side of life at HHP, focusing on the firm’s “work hard, play hard” ethos. Write an engaging, upbeat passage describing traditions such as inter-firm sporting competitions, staff retreats, and HHP’s legendary parties. Capture the spirit of camaraderie, celebration, and collective release that balanced the intensity of the firm’s professional culture. The tone should be lively, informal, and fun—providing a welcome contrast to the book’s more serious sections while still reflecting the energy and cohesion that helped define HHP’s internal life.
