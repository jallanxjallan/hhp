1. Outline the Esso Mobil case and its significance for Indonesian jurisprudence. Describe how villagers in Aceh filed suit in U.S. courts against ExxonMobil under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging human rights abuses committed by Indonesian military personnel guarding the companyâ€™s gas facility. Explain how the caseâ€”though litigated abroadâ€”raised important questions about corporate liability, extraterritorial jurisdiction, and stateâ€“private sector complicity. Highlight that while no formal Indonesian court rulings emerged from this case, its international visibility helped shape discourse on accountability, the role of foreign investors in conflict zones, and the evolving expectations of legal due diligence for multinational operations in Indonesia. Note that no public record links HHP or Baker McKenzie to the litigation.
