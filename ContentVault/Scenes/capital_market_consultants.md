1. Introduce the “Two Tutis”—Tuti Hadiputranto, whose vision and institutional approach to legal practice has been discussed in depth, and Tuti Dewi Hadinoto, who now deserves a proper introduction as her equal counterpart in the evolution of Indonesian capital markets law. Emphasize how these two pioneering women, working at the frontier of a newly forming regulatory and financial landscape, became among the first and most respected capital market legal consultants in the country. Together, they combined sharp legal acumen and forward-looking strategy to help shape the foundations of Indonesia’s capital markets regime, leaving a lasting imprint on the development of corporate and financial law in the decades that followed.
