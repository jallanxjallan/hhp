1. Describe HHPâ€™s pivotal role in the acquisition of Indonesian retail giant Matahari by a consortium led by Japanâ€™s department store operator and CVC Asia Pacific, in a transaction that blended public and private market share purchases.
2. Emphasize that the Matahari deal marked a turning point in Indonesian M&A, demonstrating how sophisticated legal structuring could facilitate foreign investment in a tightly regulated domestic market.
3. Detail how HHP advised on the use of an offshore limited partnership structureâ€”virtually unprecedented at the time in Indonesiaâ€”which allowed CVC to gain effective control without triggering formal regulatory thresholds.
4. Explain how control was exercised through a layered network of special purpose vehicles and conditional agreements, avoiding mandatory tender offers while enabling phased ownership transfer.
5. Highlight the transactionâ€™s innovative legal architecture, which incorporated global private equity practicesâ€”like drag-along rights, veto protections, brand licensing, and asset ring-fencingâ€”within an Indonesian legal framework.
6. Conclude that this deal became a landmark case study in cross-border structuring, with HHPâ€™s approach helping to define best practices for complex foreign-backed acquisitions in Indonesia.
