1. How the 1976 launch of the Palapa-A1 satellite made Indonesia the first nation in the Global South to operate its own domestic communications satellite, and how this embodied a bold assertion of national sovereignty and technological ambition.
2. The role of Indosatâ€”as a state-owned enterprise founded on the Palapa legacyâ€”in modernizing Indonesiaâ€™s communications infrastructure.
3. The significance of Indosatâ€™s 1994 initial public offerings on both the Jakarta and New York stock exchangesâ€”the first time an Indonesian state-owned company was dual-listedâ€”and how this milestone marked a turning point in the countryâ€™s economic internationalization while introducing complex legal challenges.
