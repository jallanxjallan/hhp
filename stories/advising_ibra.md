In the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis, the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) was established to restore stability and confidence in the country's financial sy
stem. Recognizing the enormity of this task, IBRA sought the expertise of leading specialists in private banking and corporate law to steer their efforts effectively. Among
 these experts, the prestigious law firm HHP stood out, taking a pivotal role in IBRA's program aimed at rehabilitating Indonesia's banking sector. HHP was instrumental in 
the initiative to identify and prune non-viable banks, allowing for restructuring processes that would ultimately forge a more resilient and robust banking landscape in Indonesia.
