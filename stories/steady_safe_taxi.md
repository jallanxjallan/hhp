In December 1998, A few months after the rupiah’s collapse, the fallout of the Asian Financial Crisis had reached the heart of Jakarta’s boardrooms. In the HHP office, the mood was anything but calm. A major Jakarta taxi company had taken out a substantial dollar-denominated loan during the boom years—when the exchange rate was stable and repayments looked easy. Now, with revenues still in rupiah and the debt burden tripled overnight, the numbers no longer added up. When the lawyers calmly explained that bankruptcy was the only remaining option, the owner erupted. He lurched across the table, shouting, knocking over a water glass and sending papers flying, his fist inches from the lead counsel’s face. Staff rushed to restrain him, but the damage was already done. The collapse of his company wouldn’t just end a local business—it threatened to bring down the foreign investment bank that had backed him.
