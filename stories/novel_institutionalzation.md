Before the 1990s, the concept of institutionalization within corporate law firms was relatively novel in Indonesia. Institutionalization refers to the process by which a law firm develops formal structures, standardized procedures, and a cohesive culture that transcend the individual contributions of its founding members. This includes creating clear hierarchies, developing a robust internal governance system, and establishing consistent service delivery models to ensure the firm‚Äôs stability, reputation, and long-term success. These principles aim to foster a collaborative environment focused on client service, professional development, and strategic growth, laying the foundation for enduring institutions rather than sole reliance on the charisma or expertise of individual lawyers. As global influences permeated Indonesia's legal sector in the 1990s, firms began adopting these practices to compete internationally and cater to the rising demand for sophisticated legal services amidst the country's economic growth.
