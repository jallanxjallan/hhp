Tuti Hadiputranto envisioned a new way of practicing law in Indonesia, where legal services were often inconsistent and unprofessional. Her early experiences exposed her to a flawed system that focused more on personal style than on the firm's values. In response, Hadiputranto dreamed of a law firm that not only adapted to changes but also excelled through a strong foundation of excellence and teamwork.

Her goal was to build a firm where shared knowledge and collective growth were central. Mentorship would play a key role, ensuring the firm's strength did not rely on any one person. Instead, it would develop new leaders internally. This innovative approach emphasized building an elite firm valued not just for its workload or prestigious clients, but for reshaping what it meant to be a legal professional in Indonesia.

At the heart of Hadiputranto's plan were lasting client relationships. Her lawyers acted as strategic partners, forming trust beyond simple business transactions. The firm was designed to be a reliable ally for local entrepreneurs and international investors, supporting their goals with confidence and dedication.

By challenging traditional practices and promoting unity and reliability, Hadiputranto set the foundation for a firm that exceeded its original vision. Her bold strategy inspired a shift in the Indonesian legal field, prioritizing institutional trust and professional excellence. Her legacy lives on as the firm rose to become one of Indonesia's top five, marking a significant change in the country's legal scene.
