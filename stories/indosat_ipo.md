In the early 1990s, Indosat emerged as a pioneering telecommunications company in Indonesia, playing a vital role in the country's communication landscape following its historic achievement as the first nation in the Global South to launch the Palapa satellite. As a sign of its growing significance, Indosat became the first Indonesian firm to be listed on both the Jakarta and New York stock exchanges, effectively broadening its reach and influencing the telecommunications sector. This period marked the beginning of significant international legal engagements for HHP , which found itself navigating its first major international legal case, an indicative milestone that would shape the firm‚Äôs reputation in corporate law.
