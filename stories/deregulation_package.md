---

In 1989, the Indonesian government introduced a series of deregulation packages aimed at creating a more favorable business environment to attract direct foreign investment. These reforms sought to simplify bureaucratic processes, reduce restrictions on foreign ownership, and enhance the overall investment climate. By easing regulations and encouraging foreign participation in various sectors, the government aimed to stimulate economic growth and development, positioning Indonesia as a competitive destination for global investors during a pivotal time in its economic landscape.
