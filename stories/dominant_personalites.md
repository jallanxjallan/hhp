In the early days of her legal career, Tuti Hadiputranto noticed major inefficiencies in how Indonesian law firms were run. Her international experiences had shown her a different approach where firms weren’t centered around one powerful partner. In Indonesia, many firms relied heavily on a single well-known partner, creating a top-heavy structure. This partner was the face of the firm, handling client relations and major court cases. Meanwhile, junior associates were stuck with menial tasks and had little chance to interact with clients or gain meaningful experience.

Tuti saw that this model, despite seeming prestigious, had serious weaknesses. When the leading partner retired or died, these firms often struggled or lost their status. The partner held most of the firm’s knowledge and client trust, leaving little behind for the firm’s continued success.

This setup also worried foreign investors interested in Indonesia’s markets. They wanted stability, a team of experts, and reliability—not just reliance on one person’s reputation. They sought partnerships with depth and consistency.

Tuti envisioned a different kind of law firm, one that focused on collaboration and sustainability rather than on a single figure. Her goal was to create an institution that was solidly built and widely respected, changing how legal practices in Indonesia were seen and operated.
