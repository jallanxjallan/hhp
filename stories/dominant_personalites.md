Tuti's extensive experience in major Indonesian law firms revealed significant challenges for foreign entities seeking reliable local legal representation. The structure of these firms often revolved around a singular prominent personalityâ€”the head partnerâ€”who dominated not only client relations but also essential legal knowledge and expertise. This monopolization meant that associates, often lacking visibility and recognition, struggled to build their own professional credibilities or create lasting relationships with clients. Consequently, when the head partner retired, an alarming amount of invaluable insights and contacts evaporated, leaving the firm vulnerable and its foreign clients uncertain about the continuity and reliability of their legal counsel. This dynamic underscores the formidable barriers foreigners face in cultivating trust and confidence in Indonesian legal representation.
