The inaugural office of HHP was a modest sublet occupying a cramped space that bore the unmistakable charm of a traditional shophouse. The atmosphere was a testament to both ambition and resourcefulness; cluttered with stacks of legal documents and piles of case files, it lacked the polished sheen of a large firmâ€™s headquarters. Within this bustling setting, a dedicated team of just five lawyers and three consultants forged the groundwork of what would become one of Jakarta's most prestigious corporate law practices. Their relentless commitment and collaborative spirit transformed this humble space into a crucible of legal ingenuity.
