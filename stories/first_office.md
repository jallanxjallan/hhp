In 1990, HHPâ€™s first office echoed the determination and grit of its founders. Nestled in a modest sub-leased corner near the prominent Landmark building in South Jakarta, this pioneering workspace was decidedly unpretentious. The space comprised just a single open-plan room, shared daily by five intrepid lawyers and three diligent consultants. The ambiance was one of relentless energy, where ideas flourished and collaboration was a constant, albeit in close quarters.

The sole enclosed space bore a hint of whimsy; a pre-existing glass cashierâ€™s booth stood at one corner of the room. This booth, more reminiscent of a bustling railway station than a law office, became the surreal signing station. Here, Tuti and Tuti Dewi orchestrated the signing of documents, pen sliding across paper through a small counter windowâ€”a scenario visible to anyone who walked through the door. It was transparency in its most literal form.

This was an office curated by necessity and resourcefulness, a testament to the self-starters within. Desks, typewriters, and early-model computers materialized not through the procurement department but from the personal commitments of the burgeoning team. Even the humble, yet enduringly practical, portable plastic hawker chairs were lugged in and assembled by the lawyers and consultants themselvesâ€”each furnishing a reflection of the teamâ€™s DIY ethos.

The informal, transparent setup inadvertently left clients to observe the entire team at their craft the moment they crossed the threshold. An abundant, palpable vitality filled the room; the buzz of industriousness was matched by a visible accountability, each lawyerâ€™s and consultantâ€™s labor laid bare for all to see.

Despite these humble beginnings, where luxury was scant and space was shared, the formative years of HHP were infused with an indomitable spirit. The modest setting belied ambitious aspirations. It was in this crucible of camaraderie that the firmâ€™s foundation was forged, driven by a strong shared purpose and an unwavering determination to rank among Jakartaâ€™s leading firms. This commitment to excellence sowed the seeds for HHPâ€™s future growth and long-enduring success. The spartan conditions bore witness to the birth of a legacy.
