In the 2000s, the landscape of Indonesian business was marked by a notable lack of legal sophistication, where agreements often remained rudimentary, with much of the contract drafting occurring in-house without the guidance of seasoned external legal experts. This environment presented a unique challenge and opportunity for HHP. Recognizing the gap, HHP diligently worked to elevate the standard of legal practice within the country by introducing sophisticated legal products that aligned with international standards. Through their efforts, HHP not only distinguished themselves as leaders in the field but also contributed significantly to the evolution and maturation of the legal framework supporting Indonesian businesses.
