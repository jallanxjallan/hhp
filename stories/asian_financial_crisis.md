In mid-1997, what began as a currency wobble in Thailand quickly spiraled into a regional economic catastrophe. When the Thai government was forced to abandon its fixed exchange rate and float the baht, investor confidence evaporated—not just in Thailand, but across Southeast Asia. Capital fled. Currencies collapsed. Stock markets plummeted. One by one, countries that had been hailed as “Asian Tigers” fell into crisis.

Indonesia was hit harder than most. For years, its economy had grown on the back of liberalization, foreign investment, and easy credit—much of it borrowed in U.S. dollars. But when the rupiah collapsed, those loans became unpayable overnight. The currency, once stable at around 2,500 per dollar, plunged to over 15,000 in a matter of months. The banking system buckled. Conglomerates defaulted. Millions lost their jobs.

The crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: opaque corporate governance, fragile banks, and overreliance on foreign debt. Into this chaos stepped the International Monetary Fund, offering bailout packages in exchange for painful reforms. Riots erupted. In May 1998, after 32 years in power, President Suharto was forced to resign amid public outrage and economic freefall.
