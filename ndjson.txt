Introduce the economic context of Indonesia in the late 1980s, a period marked by rapid transformation following decades of poverty, stagnant agriculture, and minimal infrastructure.\n2. Explain how the Suharto government began reversing this trajectory in the early 1970s through a program of state-led foreign investment, initially focused on the petroleum sector.\n3. Note that this strategy was designed and implemented by a group of U.S.-educated technocrats known as the “Berkeley Mafia,” who applied orthodox economic models to stabilize inflation, manage oil windfalls, and fund national development.\n4. Describe how the oil boom of the 1970s paid for major infrastructure, schools, and public enterprises—until the global oil crash of the early 1980s disrupted revenues and exposed structural weaknesses.\n5. Highlight how this crisis prompted a pivot to export-led manufacturing—especially in labor-intensive sectors such as garments and electronics—as a new engine of growth.\n6. Conclude by noting that, by the end of the 1980s, Indonesia had embraced a policy of global economic integration, launching a wave of deregulation in banking and capital markets under the continued leadership of its Western-trained economic planners.","params":{}},"routing":{"outputs":[{"adapter":"obsidian_writeback","target":"Indonesia in Transformation.md","mode":"append","section":"Results"}]}}
