1. Building on her exposure to international legal standards, Tuti Hadriputranto recognized that most Indonesian law firms at the time were structured around a single prominent partner whose personal reputation anchored the practice.
2. These firms operated with a steep hierarchy in which the head partner monopolized client relationships and court appearances, while junior associates performed rote tasks with limited exposure to clients or substantive legal experience.
3. Tuti observed that this model left firms institutionally weak: when the lead partner retired or passed away, the firm often dissolved or lost its standing, as much of the practical knowledge, client trust, and market value had never been shared or institutionalized.
4. She saw this as a critical structural weaknessâ€”especially from the perspective of foreign investors, who expected continuity, collaborative expertise, and dependable firm-wide competence rather than dependence on a single charismatic figure.
