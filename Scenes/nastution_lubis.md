1. Describe how Tuti Hadiputranto was part of the original group at Nasution Lubis in the 1980s, working with Adnan Buyung Nasution and Todung Mulya Lubis at a time when the firm was among the few Indonesian practices engaged in both high-level legal reform and corporate advisory work.
3. Explain how her transition from the public interest-oriented Nasution Lubis to the more corporate-focused HHP reflects the broader shift in Indonesian legal practice during the late Suharto periodâ€”from advocacy and reform to the rise of full-service commercial law firms with international affiliations.
